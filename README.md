# CodeQuiz


## Description
In this Project I created multiple-choice quiz that runs in the browser, using js, html and css. The user is prompted with a start quiz button. after starting the quiz the user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz. wrong answers result in a time deduction. when the quiz is over you can enter your name in the high scores scoreboard (work in progress).
